# What if writing tests and learning Clojure is the same thing?

Let's try.
The idea is to use this repo as a learning ground for all the things I'd like to learn.
But the purpose of the whole repo is to write the tests.
It does nothing useful.
I come away with knowledge about how things actually work, so that I can use that knowledge effectively.

## How to run the tests

    clj -A:run-tests
